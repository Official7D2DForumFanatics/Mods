Wood/Metal Path
Log Cabin->Wood Stages->Scrap Iron Stages->Steel ->Engineer Steel

Plains = Lead, Copper and Gravel

Large variety of skills locked behind Skill Books within a tiered loot system. 1st tier is mainly found on bookshelves and other household loot containers.2nd tier is found in small and large Safes. 3rd tier is found in hard to open Steel Ammunition Crates and on Ferals.

Some skill books can be learned by/taught to players via creation of the Blank Skill Book plus the appropriate resources & item’s required on a Research Desk. An Ink Pen and Book are needed to craft Blank Skill Books. Players can learn additional professions by collecting 20 profession pages and crafting another Profession Kit. Profession pages have a chance to drop in Tier 3 Ammo Boxes.

Farming:
Must be learned from the appropriate Perk. All farmable plants require tilled (fertile) dirt. All seeds are now made in a Seed Nursery. Farmers have exclusive access to create an Advanced Seed Nursery while everyone else can learn/craft its "basic" counterpart.

Everyone can learn basic farming, however only the Farmer can cultivate seeds from more advanced plants such as (Carrots, Apple Trees, Aloe Vera, Cactus, Yucca, Wheat, Mushrooms and Red Flowers). Plant growing cycles adjusted with bias toward longer growth times. Apple trees re grow Apples after being harvested.

You will need to protect your farm again because walking into fully grown, ready to harvest player planted plants will destroy the food and reset the plant to seedling stage. You can no longer pick crops they must be harvested with the players hand by hitting. Using any other tool or weapon will not return food.

Zombies and Predators:
Added over 80 Zombie variations, now you don’t know a zombies movements just by the look.

Zombies reworked to have much higher health and increased dismemberment chance but die quickly from head shots.

Fat Zombies and Ferals are now able to climb at night.

Cop Zombies "Acid Puke" now leaves burning acid on you and can be removed with water. Fat Zombies puke leaves a smell on you for a short time that attracts other Zombies. Feral Zombies spawn in cities and move almost as fast as a player. Burning Zombies move fast and fall apart more easily, after death leaving a Fire Trap. Spider Zombies move on all fours.

Bees are now venomous and drop venom sacks which are used to make Anti-venom and Venom Poison. Venom poison only effect players and can be applied to darts, spike traps and log tips. Infected animals and hordes have been added in.
