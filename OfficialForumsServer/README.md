Information:

There is now a zCoin shop at the spawn area. Test it out and grab zCoins from zombies and looting as well as tranfer your "cloud" zCoins for physical ones.

Also added was the much requested fishing mod. Put a pole together, dig for worms and right click in the water. You need 4 worms to be able to fish.

And last but not least is the RETURN of specific meats! Yes that is right. Bear Rabbit Pork and Chicken all make their returns. Raw meat is still in the game but there are NO more recipes for it available. Instead you can turn all your raw meat into one of the other 4 meats in game, so convert now and start making that Bear Stew Again!

Corpses stay until looted.
