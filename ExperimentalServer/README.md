The Experimental

DISCLAIMER: The Experimental Branch is subject to numerous map and server wipes. When new branches are released we will do everything in our power to ensure we are testing a clean and fresh version for the Fun Pimps. Please understand this as you log in. We will be giving notice of any future wiping on Experimental.

So how can you best experience all THREE of our servers? Simple. Make a backup copy of your 7 Days to Die game folder in its entirety. Best way to do this is to go into your steam folder and copy a fresh install of 7 Days to Die to somewhere else on your hard drive. You can even name this file anything you would like, such as 7D2D Hardcore or 7 Days to Die Forum Fanatics Modded.

Information:

In order to play the Experimental Branch you need opt in to the beta for the Branch in your Steam. Here are instructions on how to do so straight from the Pimps themselves:

Here's how to opt in and play the latest experimental branch.

Open your steam client.
Click on Games/View Games Library
Right click ‘7 Days to Die’ and select properties
From the new popup dialogue box select the ‘BETAS’ Tab
Under ‘Select the beta you would like to opt into’ latest_experimental
The game will then update and download the latest experimental build Alpha 14.6
Switching back to the latest main stable build is as easy as repeating steps 1-4 and on step 5 choose the option ‘None – Opt out of all Beta Programs’ and you’ll revert to the latest stable build

In the drop down you want to make sure you select latest experimental- unstable build. NOT the u52 ones.

The password is the same one you use for every other server, and all of you in the ORIGINAL Forum Fanatics server has already been whitelisted. Thats it. Join us for a pure Vanilla unmodded Test Server Branch and lets all help the Pimps together squash those bugs!
